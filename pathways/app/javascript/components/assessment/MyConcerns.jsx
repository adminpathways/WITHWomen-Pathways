                We all balance many areas of our life like housing, finances, families and our health. As we think
                about making change, knowing which areas are at the top of our list can help us decide where to start.

                <b>Pathways</b> helps you figure out whatâ€™s most important to you. The help and resources provided
                in Pathways will then be matched to your top concern. You&#39;ll be presented with two of these issues
                at a time.

                Some issues may be hard to prioritize. There are no right or wrong answers, just do your best.
