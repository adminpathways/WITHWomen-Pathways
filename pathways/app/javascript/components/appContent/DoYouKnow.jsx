                    includes things like questioning where you go, reading your texts and emails and monitoring your
                    phone and social media activity. These types of behaviours limit your contact with friends,
                    family and other people who would support you.</p>

                    behaviours to make you feel ashamed or at fault for things.</p>

                    about you. This can qualify as stalking or cyber-stalking. In many cases, this is a crime.</p>

                    <p>This is an example of sexual violence. Even in marriages and committed
                    relationships, a partner cannot force you into sexual activity. Sex without consent is against the
                    law. Other examples of sexual violence include continued sexual contact when asked to stop
                    and making someone commit sexual acts that humiliate them.</p>

                    cause an injury to count. Any behaviour that causes pain or fear is unacceptable.
                    Other behaviours that can be experienced in unsafe relationships include choking/strangling,
                    stabbing/cutting, biting, burning, locking in a room, tying down, hitting, pinching,
                    slapping, kicking, punching, or assault with a weapon.</p>

                    down and using words to make you doubt yourself. This can harm your self-confidence and
                    make you become emotionally dependent on them.</p>

        bottomDescription: <p>Unsafe behaviours include these and many more. Any one of these actions on their own
            might not be a problem, but together they make a relationship unsafe. Everyone deserves to be treated
            with kindness and respect. You are not to blame for a partner or ex-partner’s unsafe behaviours.<br/><br/>

            <p>Even people who seem nice to others, and who are at times nice to their partners
            can do things to make a relationship unsafe. Unsafe behaviours start out slowly, and don’t
            happen all at once. It makes it hard for us in these relationships and our friends and
            family to notice that the relationship is not safe.</p>

            <p>Having a social support system means having friends and family to turn to, and resources that
            you can access in times of need or crisis. Social Support includes people who won’t gossip, judge
            or tell you what to do. For example: <br/>
            (1) Friends and family that you trust<br/>
            (2) Helping professionals who can share information and have supported other people with
            experiences that are similar to yours <br/>
            (3) Peers, who are people you can meet who have gone through some of the same things that you have</p>

            <p>Unsafe behaviours do not happen because of things like drinking, drugs, cultural background,
            anger, or poverty. There is no common reason or excuse for these behaviours.
            Unsafe relationships are experienced by people from all walks of life, and if you are
            experiencing these behaviours, it is never your fault.
