# WITHWomen Pathways

Between 25- 50 percent of women worldwide will experience physical, sexual and/or psychological violence from a partner in their lifetime. Apps help women recognize the danger early and also help them plan for safety. WITHWomen Pathways is a safety decision support app that helps women in unsafe romantic relationships to think about and clarify their priorities in life and plan for the safety of themselves and their loved ones. If you chose to download and or modify the app, please feel free to email us at WithWomen@smh.ca to find out more about its use and any other questions.
